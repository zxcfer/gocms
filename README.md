FastSchema is an open-source headless Content Management System (CMS) designed to simplify the creation and management of structured content. By leveraging schema definitions, FastSchema automates the generation of databases and provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs effortlessly.

## Try it out

You can try out FastSchema by running FastSchema in a Docker container.

### Pull the Docker Image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/fastschema/fastschema:latest
```

### Run the Docker Container:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/fastschema/data \
  ghcr.io/fastschema/fastschema:latest
```

**Example output:**

```
> APP_KEY is not set. A new key is generated and saved to /fastschema/data/.env
> Using the default sqlite db file path: /fastschema/data/fastschema.db
> Visit the following URL to setup the app: http://localhost:8000/dash/setup/?token=lUDRgoTUUNDsjCcitgGFTqwMZQPmYvlU
```

Now you can access to the FastSchema setup page by visiting [http://localhost:8000/setup?token=\{token\}](http://localhost:8000?token=\{token\}) (The setup token is displayed in the terminal).

> **Note:** FastSchema is currently in beta and under active development. We welcome feedback, contributions, and suggestions from the community to help improve the platform and make it more robust and feature-rich.


## Overview

### Schema Definition

The schema definition is structured JSON that encapsulates the characteristics of your content model. Let's take a closer look at a sample schema definition:

**post.json**

```json
{
  "name": "post",
  "namespace": "posts",
  "label_field": "name",
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "string",
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "sortable": true
    },
    {
      "type": "relation",
      "name": "category",
      "label": "Category",
      "renderer": {},
      "relation": {
        "schema": "category",
        "field": "posts",
        "type": "o2m"
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

**category.json**

```json
{
  "name": "category",
  "namespace": "categories",
  "label_field": "name",
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "string",
      "name": "name",
      "label": "Name",
      "optional": true,
      "sortable": true
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "name": "content",
      "label": "Content",
      "renderer": {
        "class": "editor"
      },
      "optional": true,
      "sortable": true
    },
    {
      "type": "relation",
      "name": "posts",
      "label": "Posts",
      "optional": true,
      "relation": {
        "schema": "post",
        "field": "category",
        "type": "o2m",
        "owner": true,
        "optional": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example

#### Query

```
GET /api/users/?sort=-age&select=name,email,groups.name&filter={filterObject}
```

```json
{
  "name": {
    "$like": "test%",
    "$neq": "test2"
  },
  "$or": [
    {
      "email": {
        "$neq": "test",
        "$like": "test%"
      },
      "age": {
        "$lt": 10
      }
    },
    {
      "age": 5
    },
    {
      "$and": [
        {
          "name": {
            "$neq": "test2"
          }
        },
        {
          "age": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

#### Update

```
PUT /api/users/1
```

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "room": { "id": 2 },
  "pets": [ { "id": 2 }, { "id": 3 } ],
  "groups": [ { "id": 4 }, { "id": 5 } ],
  "$set": {
    "bio": "Hello World",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "sub_room": { "id": 2 },
    "sub_pets": [ { "id": 2 }, { "id": 3 } ],
    "sub_groups": [ { "id": 4 }, { "id": 5 } ]
  },
  "$clear": {
    "bio": true,
    "address": true,
    "room": true,
    "sub_pets": true,
    "sub_groups": true,
    "pets": [ { "id": 2 }, { "id": 3 } ],
    "groups": [ { "id": 4 }, { "id": 5 } ]
  },
  "$add": {
    "pets": [ { "id": 2 }, { "id": 3 } ],
    "groups": [ { "id": 4 }, { "id": 5 } ],
    "age": 1,
    "salary": 1000
  },
  "$expr": {
    "bio": "LOWER(`bio`)",
    "address": "CONCAT(`address`, ' ', `city`, ' ', `state`, ' ', `zip`)"
  }
}
```

## Extend

FastSchema is a flexible and extensible application that allows you to customize and extend its functionality to meet your specific requirements. This guide provides an overview of the different ways you can extend FastSchema, including customizing the API, adding new features, and integrating with third-party services.

### Using FastSchema as a module

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/fastschema/fastschema"
	"github.com/fastschema/fastschema/app"
	"github.com/fastschema/fastschema/schema"
)

func main() {
	newApp, err := fastschema.New(&fastschema.AppConfig{})

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	newApp.AddResource(
		app.NewResource("home", func(c app.Context, _ *any) (any, error) {
			return "Welcome to fastschema", nil
		}, app.Meta{app.GET: ""}),
	)

	newApp.OnAfterDBContentList(
    func(query *app.QueryOptions, entities []*schema.Entity) ([]*schema.Entity, error) {
      if query.Model.Schema().Name != "media" {
        return entities, nil
      }

      for _, entity := range entities {
        entity.Set("custom", true)
      }

      return entities, nil
    },
  )

	newApp.Start()
}
```


## Roadmap

* [ ] Improve documentation and testing.
* [ ] Add auth provider.
* [ ] Plugin system.
* [ ] OpenAPI generator.
* [ ] Real-time updates.
* [ ] GraphQL support.
* [ ] Webhooks.
* [ ] Client SDKs.


## Testing

FastSchema comes with a suite of automated tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the platform.

*Fastschema come with integration tests that require a database connection. You can use the following command to create DB containers.*

```bash
cd tests/integration
docker compose up -d
```

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```

You can skip the integration tests by running tests for packages only.

```bash
./tests/test.sh ./schema
```


## Known Issues

### Rename M2M field

Rename M2M field is depend on the column rename. Fastschema migrations is built on top of the Ent migrations.
Ent use ariga.io/atlast and it cause error with sqlite (ariga.io/atlas@v0.21.1/sql/sqlite/migrate.go.modifyTable).

Currently, Atlas sqlite driver need to perform copyRows to a temporary table. But it use the `new` column name to copy the rows. This column is not existed in the table, because it's not renamed yet. This will cause the error: `SQL logic error: no such column:`.

The problem seem to be fixed in this PR: https://github.com/ariga/atlas/pull/2672
